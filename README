Lightweight MySQL connection multiplexing proxy.

This was developed for internal use by MyFitnessPal (http://www.myfitnesspal.com)
and is being open-sourced with their permission.

Please see the file OVERVIEW for details about this program.



Building:
---------

The only real external dependency is libevent2; get it via "apt-get install libevent-dev"
or build it from http://libevent.org/.  Any 2.x version should work.

To build just run 'make'.


Running:
--------

You can specify one or more config options via -c commandline options.

To keep things simple, the overall configuration options are in 'defaults.cfg'
and the database backend configurations are in 'development.cfg', 'production.cfg', etc,
depending on your environment.  So you would typically run the proxy like this:

$ ./proxy example_configs/defaults.cfg example_configs/development.cfg



STUFF YET NOT IMPLEMENTED
=========================

- Prepared statements (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/prepared-statements.html)
- Stored procedures with multi-resultsets (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/stored-procedures.html)
- SSL and compression support for connections
- LOAD DATA INFILE - connect to the databases directly if you want to use this
